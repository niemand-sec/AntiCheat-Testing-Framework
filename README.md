# AntiCheat-Testing-Framework
This is a framework to test any Anti-Cheat on the market. The code can be used as template or code base to test any Anti-Cheat and learn along the way. The entry level to reverse AntiCheats and Cheats is quite high, therefore, I'm releasing all the code I developed during my research. The main idea is to help people and motivate them to get into this interesting topic with many research avenues and topics.

All this code is the result of research done for Recon2019 (Montreal) and BlackHat Europe 2019 (London).

- **Description for each module can be found on each folder**.
- Modules can be used together or separated. 
- Cuztomization should be simple due to the modularity of the code.

# Usage

Most of the settings can be done by using the config.ini file, however, some modules may require particular settings in the code, depending on your intentions.

> Remember to change location of config.ini file at CheatHelper/CheatHelper.cpp (variable configFile)
