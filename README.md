# AntiCheat-Testing-Framework
Framework to test any Anti-Cheat on the market. This can be used as Template or Code Base to test any Anti-Cheat and learn along the way. The entry level to reverse AntiCheats and Cheats is quite high, therefore, I'm realeasing all the code I developed during my research. The main idea is to help people and motivate them to get into this topic which is really interesting and there is a lot to research about it.

All this code is the result of a research done for Recon2019 (Montreal) and BlackHat Europe 2019 (London).

- **Description for each module can be found on each folder**.
- Modules can be used together or separated. 
- Customization should be simple due to the modularity of the code.

# Usage

Most of the settings can be done by using config.ini file, however, some modules may require particular settings on the code, depending on your intentions.

> Remember to change location of config.ini file at CheatHelper/CheatHelper.cpp (variable configFile)
